                    Dear delegates and advisors,
                    <br><br> It is with great pride and excitement that we formally invite you to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s 14th annual Model United Nations Conference!
                    <br><br> MITMUNC is a premier Model UN conference in which students from all over the world come together to solve the most pressing issues facing society today. Normally held on MIT’s campus in Cambridge, we are adapting to unprecedented
                    times by bringing a <b>virtual conference</b> to you. By doing so, we hope to emphasize accessibility for delegates from all backgrounds and experience levels. This year’s conference will be held during the <b>weekend of Friday, February 5th through Sunday, February 7th, 2021.</b>
                    <br><br> At its core, MITMUNC is planned, organized, and directed by a <b>passionate and ambitious team of MIT
            students</b> that collectively form a diverse family of academic backgrounds and experiences. Our chairs and staff coordinate MITMUNC’s committees from the ground up, posing questions and controversies that even the most experienced delegates
                    will find challenging. Our dedicated Secretariat members complement the chairs and staff by overseeing all conference preparations, months in advance of the conference in order to ensure that our delegates walk away with one of the
                    greatest experiences of their lives.
                    <br><br> In previous years, <b>MITMUNC delegates grappled with complicated human rights, economic, and environmental
            topics</b> such as the Syrian Refugee crisis, argued the pros and cons of nuclear energy in the International Atomic Energy Agency, and even reacted to a flurry of assassinations witnessed in the Historical Committee! Attendees also enjoyed
                    inspiring keynote addresses by Nazli Choucri, Professor of Political Science at MIT and leading researcher in international relations and cyber politics, as well as Richard B. Freeman, Faculty co-Director of the Labor and Worklife
                    Program at the Harvard Law School. Delegates also enjoyed a well-deserved respite at the Delegate Dance social night.
                    <br><br> We pride ourselves in hosting smaller committee sizes. This allows our attendees more freedom to contribute and distinguish themselves in their individual committee sessions. MITMUNC offers its attendees a truly unique opportunity
                    to immerse themselves in a <b>demanding intellectual environment</b>, exposed to the ideas of others and tasked to employ the art of negotiation to pass meaningful resolutions.
                    <br><br> Having experienced MITMUNC as chairs, then as Secretariat members and Secretaries-General, we are both humbled and thrilled to guide MITMUNC into its best conference yet. I now invite you to explore our brand new website to
                    learn more about our conference. Do not hesitate in contacting us should you encounter any doubts along the way. <b>Best of luck in the path ahead!</b>
                    <br><br> Sincerely,
                    <br> Jo Nikolova and Jorge Perez
