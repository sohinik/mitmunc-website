  <div class="panel">
    <h3 class="paragraphtext">
      Dear delegates and advisors, 
      <br><br>
      It is with great pride and excitement that we formally invite you to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s 13th annual Model United Nations Conference! 
      <br><br>
      MITMUNC is a premier Model UN conference in which students from all over the world come together to solve the most pressing issues facing society today. Normally held on MIT’s campus in Cambridge, we are adapting to unprecedented times by bringing a virtual conference to you. By doing so, we hope to emphasize accessibility for delegates from all backgrounds and experience levels. This year’s conference will be held during the weekend of Friday, February 5th through Sunday, February 7th, 2021. 
      <br><br>
      At its core, MITMUNC is planned, organized, and directed by a passionate and ambitious team of MIT students that collectively form a diverse family of academic backgrounds and experiences. Our chairs and staff coordinate MITMUNC’s committees from the ground up, posing questions and controversies that even the most experienced delegates will find challenging. Our dedicated Secretariat members complement the chairs and staff by overseeing all conference preparations, months in advance of the conference in order to ensure that our delegates walk away with one of the greatest experiences of their lives. 
      <br><br>
      In previous years, MITMUNC delegates grappled with complicated human rights, economic, and environmental topics such as the Syrian Refugee crisis, argued the pros and cons of nuclear energy in the International Atomic Energy Agency, and even reacted to a flurry of assassinations witnessed in the Historical Committee! Attendees also enjoyed inspiring keynote addresses by Nazli Choucri, Professor of Political Science at MIT and leading researcher in international relations and cyber politics, as well as Richard B. Freeman, Faculty co-Director of the Labor and Worklife Program at the Harvard Law School. Delegates also enjoyed a well-deserved respite at the Delegate Dance social night. 
      <br><br>
      We pride ourselves in hosting smaller committee sizes. This allows our attendees more freedom to contribute and distinguish themselves in their individual committee sessions. MITMUNC offers its attendees a truly unique opportunity to immerse themselves in a demanding intellectual environment, exposed to the ideas of others and tasked to employ the art of negotiation to pass meaningful resolutions. 
      <br><br>
      Having experienced MITMUNC as chairs, then as Secretariat members and Secretaries-General, we are both humbled and thrilled to guide MITMUNC into its best conference yet. I now invite you to explore our brand new website to learn more about our conference. Do not hesitate in contacting us should you encounter any doubts along the way. Best of luck in the path ahead! 
      <br><br>
      Sincerely,<br>
      Ting Li and Sarah Quraishi<br>

  <div class="panel">
    <h3 class="paragraphtext">
      The MIT Model United Nations Conference (MITMUNC) is very proud to announce the first branch of our conference outside of the United States, MITMUNC China!
      <br><br>
      MITMUNC China 2020 is adapting during these unprecedented times to provide an equally fulfilling experience for our delegates. The fourth edition of MITMUNC China will be held virtually over Zoom from Friday, August 14rd through Sunday, August 16th, 2020 and consist of six unique committees, each directed by MIT undergraduate students. All committee directors have previously chaired for our flagship MITMUNC conference, held annually at MIT in the early spring, and had a great experience with this unique cross-cultural opportunity.
      <br><br>
      MITMUNC China is closely co-organized with ASDAN China. ASDAN is an educational non-profit based in the United Kingdom and offers international educational programs in China, Europe, North America. MITMUNC China is a three-day conference that follows a similar schedule to our flagship conference, with the same rules and procedures.
      <br><br>
      Above all, MITMUNC China offers hundreds of Chinese high school students across the Asian nation the opportunity to debate upon important international issues posing veritable challenges to the world today, such as the reality of climate change, cybersecurity, and refugee assistance in conflict zones.
      <br><br>
      MITMUNC China challenges its delegates to cooperate and perform their very best to develop feasible solutions to these diverse problems. MITMUNC China’s mission resonates very closely with the MIT Campaign for a Better World, pursuing education, research, and innovation with a passion for serious impact.
      <br><br>
      We are thrilled on the renewal of this as an annual venture and all look forward to meeting the fourth group of MITMUNC China delegates come next August!
